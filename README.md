Welcome to the eBid repository, an online collectibles auction website designed and developed as part of a project for the "Desenvolvimento de Software para Web 2" (Web Software Development 2) course at UFSCar (Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos). This project aims to create an engaging and interactive platform for collectibles enthusiasts, facilitating the buying and selling of exclusive and rare items through real-time auctions.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactTS:** The project has been migrated to use React with TypeScript, providing a more structured and scalable codebase for building user interfaces.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS has been adopted for styling, offering a utility-first approach that streamlines the design process and ensures a consistent and responsive layout.

- **JSON-Server:** The simulated database is now implemented using JSON-Server, allowing for a lightweight and easy-to-use solution for testing and development.

- **LocalStorage:** LocalStorage is utilized to simulate the storage of user bids, providing a seamless and persistent experience for users bidding on collectibles.
